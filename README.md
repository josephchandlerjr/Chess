# Chess 

This started out as a console chess game. Now it has a GUI using swing components. 
You'll see additional classes suchs as PGNFile which were used by the original console game but
are not longer relevant to the GUI version.

## Build

This was coded in a Windows 7 environment and has yet to be tested elsewhere.
Clone the repository, cd into the root director \chess and enter
javac -d .\classes .\src\chess\\*.java

 
Run the GUI board by entering


cd classes

 
java chess.GuiChess
