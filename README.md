# Chess 

First real thing I've built. This started out as a console chess game and I basically stuck some
swing components on top of it. Clone the repository and compile from root thus: 
javac -d .\classes .\src\test\*.java .\src\chess\*.java
Run the GUI board thus: 
java -classpath .\classes chess.GuiChess
